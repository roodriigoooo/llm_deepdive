    "# Classification of Movie Reviews\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook trains classifiers that take a movie review and decide if it is positive or negative. This is an instance of sentence classification, i.e. classifying an input sentence into a predefined set of categories. In turn, it is an instance of text classification. For our movie reviews, texts are one-sentence reviews, and the categories (or labels) are either positive or negative. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a simplified task. In general, these labels are not exclusive: a sentence can be both positive and negative (\"I love the script but hate the main actor.\"), or simply be neutral, which means that a sentence is neither positive nor negative (\"I went to the movies.\"). \n",
    "\n",
    "Text classification is a wide area. You'll find plenty of background on it. It is a \"simple\" task in NLP, also studied in Information Retrieval and used as testbed of machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a paper using Convolutional Neural Networks for sentence classification: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1408.5882.pdf .  This notebook uses one of the datasets used in that paper. However, the results are not directly comparable (because the split into train and test is not exactly the same). In any case, we can see that many models get a test accuracy in between 75% and 82%. \n"

    "\n",
    "Consider the label \"positive\". There are truly positive examples, and if a classifier predicts \"negative\" for a positive example, it is making a \"false negative\" mistake, because the example is not negative. Now consider a truly negative example, if our classifier predicts \"positive\" it will make a \"false positive\" mistake. False positives and false negatives are all mistakes, and normal accuracy does not distinguish. Precision and recall specifically look at each of the sides of mistakes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Precision looks at \"false positive\" mistakes. Specifically, it is the fraction of true positives out of the total number of examples where a classifier predicts \"positive\". A precision of 100% means that every time a classifier says \"positive\" the example is truly positive. Lower precision means that there are false positives among our predictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Recall looks at \"false negative\" mistakes. Out of all truly positive examples, it is the fraction that is correctly labeled as \"positive\". A recall of 100% means that our classifier will identify all truly positive examples in the data, probably at the expense of making precision mistakes. An extreme case is a dumb classifier that always predicts \"positive\", it will have recall at 100%, but precision will be the fraction of true positives in the test data."
