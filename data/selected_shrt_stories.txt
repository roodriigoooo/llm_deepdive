A green and yellow parrot, which hung in a cage outside the door, kept
repeating over and over:
“Allez vous-en! Allez vous-en! Sapristi! That’s all
right!”
He could speak a little Spanish, and also a language which nobody understood,
unless it was the mocking-bird that hung on the other side of the door,
whistling his fluty notes out upon the breeze with maddening persistence.
Mr. Pontellier, unable to read his newspaper with any degree of comfort, arose
with an expression and an exclamation of disgust.
He walked down the gallery and across the narrow “bridges” which
connected the Lebrun cottages one with the other. He had been seated before the
door of the main house. The parrot and the mocking-bird were the property of
Madame Lebrun, and they had the right to make all the noise they wished. Mr.
Pontellier had the privilege of quitting their society when they ceased to be
entertaining.
He stopped before the door of his own cottage, which was the fourth one from
the main building and next to the last. Seating himself in a wicker rocker
which was there, he once more applied himself to the task of reading the
newspaper. The day was Sunday; the paper was a day old. The Sunday papers had
not yet reached Grand Isle. He was already acquainted with the market reports,
and he glanced restlessly over the editorials and bits of news which he had not
had time to read before quitting New Orleans the day before.
Mr. Pontellier wore eye-glasses. He was a man of forty, of medium height and
rather slender build; he stooped a little. His hair was brown and straight,
parted on one side. His beard was neatly and closely trimmed.
Once in a while he withdrew his glance from the newspaper and looked about him.
There was more noise than ever over at the house. The main building was called
“the house,” to distinguish it from the cottages. The chattering
and whistling birds were still at it. Two young girls, the Farival twins, were
playing a duet from “Zampa” upon the piano. Madame Lebrun was
bustling in and out, giving orders in a high key to a yard-boy whenever she got
inside the house, and directions in an equally high voice to a dining-room
servant whenever she got outside. She was a fresh, pretty woman, clad always in
white with elbow sleeves. Her starched skirts crinkled as she came and went.
Farther down, before one of the cottages, a lady in black was walking demurely
up and down, telling her beads. A good many persons of the pension had
gone over to the Chênière Caminada in Beaudelet’s lugger to hear
mass. Some young people were out under the water-oaks playing croquet. Mr.
Pontellier’s two children were there—sturdy little fellows of four
and five. A quadroon nurse followed them about with a faraway, meditative air.
Mr. Pontellier finally lit a cigar and began to smoke, letting the paper drag
idly from his hand. He fixed his gaze upon a white sunshade that was advancing
at snail’s pace from the beach. He could see it plainly between the gaunt
trunks of the water-oaks and across the stretch of yellow camomile. The gulf
looked far away, melting hazily into the blue of the horizon. The sunshade
continued to approach slowly. Beneath its pink-lined shelter were his wife,
Mrs. Pontellier, and young Robert Lebrun. When they reached the cottage, the
two seated themselves with some appearance of fatigue upon the upper step of
the porch, facing each other, each leaning against a supporting post.
“What folly! to bathe at such an hour in such heat!” exclaimed Mr.
Pontellier. He himself had taken a plunge at daylight. That was why the morning
seemed long to him.
“You are burnt beyond recognition,” he added, looking at his wife
as one looks at a valuable piece of personal property which has suffered some
damage. She held up her hands, strong, shapely hands, and surveyed them
critically, drawing up her fawn sleeves above the wrists. Looking at them
reminded her of her rings, which she had given to her husband before leaving
for the beach. She silently reached out to him, and he, understanding, took the
rings from his vest pocket and dropped them into her open palm. She slipped
them upon her fingers; then clasping her knees, she looked across at Robert and
began to laugh. The rings sparkled upon her fingers. He sent back an answering
smile.
“What is it?” asked Pontellier, looking lazily and amused from one
to the other. It was some utter nonsense; some adventure out there in the
water, and they both tried to relate it at once. It did not seem half so
amusing when told. They realized this, and so did Mr. Pontellier. He yawned and
stretched himself. Then he got up, saying he had half a mind to go over to
Klein’s hotel and play a game of billiards.
“Come go along, Lebrun,” he proposed to Robert. But Robert admitted
quite frankly that he preferred to stay where he was and talk to Mrs.
Pontellier.
“Well, send him about his business when he bores you, Edna,”
instructed her husband as he prepared to leave.
“Here, take the umbrella,” she exclaimed, holding it out to him. He
accepted the sunshade, and lifting it over his head descended the steps and
walked away.
“Coming back to dinner?” his wife called after him. He halted a
moment and shrugged his shoulders. He felt in his vest pocket; there was a
ten-dollar bill there. He did not know; perhaps he would return for the early
dinner and perhaps he would not. It all depended upon the company which he
found over at Klein’s and the size of “the game.” He did not
say this, but she understood it, and laughed, nodding good-by to him.
Both children wanted to follow their father when they saw him starting out. He
kissed them and promised to bring them back bonbons and peanuts.

Mrs. Pontellier’s eyes were quick and bright; they were a yellowish
brown, about the color of her hair. She had a way of turning them swiftly upon
an object and holding them there as if lost in some inward maze of
contemplation or thought.
Her eyebrows were a shade darker than her hair. They were thick and almost
horizontal, emphasizing the depth of her eyes. She was rather handsome than
beautiful. Her face was captivating by reason of a certain frankness of
expression and a contradictory subtle play of features. Her manner was
engaging.
Robert rolled a cigarette. He smoked cigarettes because he could not afford
cigars, he said. He had a cigar in his pocket which Mr. Pontellier had
presented him with, and he was saving it for his after-dinner smoke.
This seemed quite proper and natural on his part. In coloring he was not unlike
his companion. A clean-shaved face made the resemblance more pronounced than it
would otherwise have been. There rested no shadow of care upon his open
countenance. His eyes gathered in and reflected the light and languor of the
summer day.
Mrs. Pontellier reached over for a palm-leaf fan that lay on the porch and
began to fan herself, while Robert sent between his lips light puffs from his
cigarette. They chatted incessantly: about the things around them; their
amusing adventure out in the water—it had again assumed its entertaining
aspect; about the wind, the trees, the people who had gone to the
Chênière; about the children playing croquet under the oaks, and the
Farival twins, who were now performing the overture to “The Poet and the
Peasant.”
Robert talked a good deal about himself. He was very young, and did not know
any better. Mrs. Pontellier talked a little about herself for the same reason.
Each was interested in what the other said. Robert spoke of his intention to go
to Mexico in the autumn, where fortune awaited him. He was always intending to
go to Mexico, but some way never got there. Meanwhile he held on to his modest
position in a mercantile house in New Orleans, where an equal familiarity with
English, French and Spanish gave him no small value as a clerk and
correspondent.
He was spending his summer vacation, as he always did, with his mother at Grand
Isle. In former times, before Robert could remember, “the house”
had been a summer luxury of the Lebruns. Now, flanked by its dozen or more
cottages, which were always filled with exclusive visitors from the
“Quartier Français,” it enabled Madame Lebrun to maintain
the easy and comfortable existence which appeared to be her birthright.
Mrs. Pontellier talked about her father’s Mississippi plantation and her
girlhood home in the old Kentucky blue-grass country. She was an American
woman, with a small infusion of French which seemed to have been lost in
dilution. She read a letter from her sister, who was away in the East, and who
had engaged herself to be married. Robert was interested, and wanted to know
what manner of girls the sisters were, what the father was like, and how long
the mother had been dead.
When Mrs. Pontellier folded the letter it was time for her to dress for the
early dinner.
“I see Léonce isn’t coming back,” she said, with a glance in
the direction whence her husband had disappeared. Robert supposed he was not,
as there were a good many New Orleans club men over at Klein’s.
When Mrs. Pontellier left him to enter her room, the young man descended the
steps and strolled over toward the croquet players, where, during the half-hour
before dinner, he amused himself with the little Pontellier children, who were
very fond of him.

It was eleven o’clock that night when Mr. Pontellier returned from
Klein’s hotel. He was in an excellent humor, in high spirits, and very
talkative. His entrance awoke his wife, who was in bed and fast asleep when he
came in. He talked to her while he undressed, telling her anecdotes and bits of
news and gossip that he had gathered during the day. From his trousers pockets
he took a fistful of crumpled bank notes and a good deal of silver coin, which
he piled on the bureau indiscriminately with keys, knife, handkerchief, and
whatever else happened to be in his pockets. She was overcome with sleep, and
answered him with little half utterances.
He thought it very discouraging that his wife, who was the sole object of his
existence, evinced so little interest in things which concerned him, and valued
so little his conversation.
Mr. Pontellier had forgotten the bonbons and peanuts for the boys.
Notwithstanding he loved them very much, and went into the adjoining room where
they slept to take a look at them and make sure that they were resting
comfortably. The result of his investigation was far from satisfactory. He
turned and shifted the youngsters about in bed. One of them began to kick and
talk about a basket full of crabs.
Mr. Pontellier returned to his wife with the information that Raoul had a high
fever and needed looking after. Then he lit a cigar and went and sat near the
open door to smoke it.
Mrs. Pontellier was quite sure Raoul had no fever. He had gone to bed perfectly
well, she said, and nothing had ailed him all day. Mr. Pontellier was too well
acquainted with fever symptoms to be mistaken. He assured her the child was
consuming at that moment in the next room.
He reproached his wife with her inattention, her habitual neglect of the
children. If it was not a mother’s place to look after children, whose on
earth was it? He himself had his hands full with his brokerage business. He
could not be in two places at once; making a living for his family on the
street, and staying at home to see that no harm befell them. He talked in a
monotonous, insistent way.
Mrs. Pontellier sprang out of bed and went into the next room. She soon came
back and sat on the edge of the bed, leaning her head down on the pillow. She
said nothing, and refused to answer her husband when he questioned her. When
his cigar was smoked out he went to bed, and in half a minute he was fast
asleep.
Mrs. Pontellier was by that time thoroughly awake. She began to cry a little,
and wiped her eyes on the sleeve of her peignoir. Blowing out the
candle, which her husband had left burning, she slipped her bare feet into a
pair of satin mules at the foot of the bed and went out on the porch,
where she sat down in the wicker chair and began to rock gently to and fro.
It was then past midnight. The cottages were all dark. A single faint light
gleamed out from the hallway of the house. There was no sound abroad except the
hooting of an old owl in the top of a water-oak, and the everlasting voice of
the sea, that was not uplifted at that soft hour. It broke like a mournful
lullaby upon the night.
The tears came so fast to Mrs. Pontellier’s eyes that the damp sleeve of
her peignoir no longer served to dry them. She was holding the back of
her chair with one hand; her loose sleeve had slipped almost to the shoulder of
her uplifted arm. Turning, she thrust her face, steaming and wet, into the bend
of her arm, and she went on crying there, not caring any longer to dry her
face, her eyes, her arms. She could not have told why she was crying. Such
experiences as the foregoing were not uncommon in her married life. They seemed
never before to have weighed much against the abundance of her husband’s
kindness and a uniform devotion which had come to be tacit and self-understood.
An indescribable oppression, which seemed to generate in some unfamiliar part
of her consciousness, filled her whole being with a vague anguish. It was like
a shadow, like a mist passing across her soul’s summer day. It was
strange and unfamiliar; it was a mood. She did not sit there inwardly
upbraiding her husband, lamenting at Fate, which had directed her footsteps to
the path which they had taken. She was just having a good cry all to herself.
The mosquitoes made merry over her, biting her firm, round arms and nipping at
her bare insteps.
The little stinging, buzzing imps succeeded in dispelling a mood which might
have held her there in the darkness half a night longer.
The following morning Mr. Pontellier was up in good time to take the rockaway
which was to convey him to the steamer at the wharf. He was returning to the
city to his business, and they would not see him again at the Island till the
coming Saturday. He had regained his composure, which seemed to have been
somewhat impaired the night before. He was eager to be gone, as he looked
forward to a lively week in Carondelet Street.
Mr. Pontellier gave his wife half of the money which he had brought away from
Klein’s hotel the evening before. She liked money as well as most women,
and accepted it with no little satisfaction.
“It will buy a handsome wedding present for Sister Janet!” she
exclaimed, smoothing out the bills as she counted them one by one.
“Oh! we’ll treat Sister Janet better than that, my dear,” he
laughed, as he prepared to kiss her good-by.
The boys were tumbling about, clinging to his legs, imploring that numerous
things be brought back to them. Mr. Pontellier was a great favorite, and
ladies, men, children, even nurses, were always on hand to say good-by to him.
His wife stood smiling and waving, the boys shouting, as he disappeared in the
old rockaway down the sandy road.
A few days later a box arrived for Mrs. Pontellier from New Orleans. It was
from her husband. It was filled with friandises, with luscious and
toothsome bits—the finest of fruits, patés, a rare bottle or two,
delicious syrups, and bonbons in abundance.
Mrs. Pontellier was always very generous with the contents of such a box; she
was quite used to receiving them when away from home. The patés and
fruit were brought to the dining-room; the bonbons were passed around. And the
ladies, selecting with dainty and discriminating fingers and a little greedily,
all declared that Mr. Pontellier was the best husband in the world. Mrs.
Pontellier was forced to admit that she knew of none better.

It would have been a difficult matter for Mr. Pontellier to define to his own
satisfaction or any one else’s wherein his wife failed in her duty toward
their children. It was something which he felt rather than perceived, and he
never voiced the feeling without subsequent regret and ample atonement.
If one of the little Pontellier boys took a tumble whilst at play, he was not
apt to rush crying to his mother’s arms for comfort; he would more likely
pick himself up, wipe the water out of his eyes and the sand out of his mouth,
and go on playing. Tots as they were, they pulled together and stood their
ground in childish battles with doubled fists and uplifted voices, which
usually prevailed against the other mother-tots. The quadroon nurse was looked
upon as a huge encumbrance, only good to button up waists and panties and to
brush and part hair; since it seemed to be a law of society that hair must be
parted and brushed.
In short, Mrs. Pontellier was not a mother-woman. The mother-women seemed to
prevail that summer at Grand Isle. It was easy to know them, fluttering about
with extended, protecting wings when any harm, real or imaginary, threatened
their precious brood. They were women who idolized their children, worshiped
their husbands, and esteemed it a holy privilege to efface themselves as
individuals and grow wings as ministering angels.
Many of them were delicious in the role; one of them was the embodiment of
every womanly grace and charm. If her husband did not adore her, he was a
brute, deserving of death by slow torture. Her name was Adèle Ratignolle. There
are no words to describe her save the old ones that have served so often to
picture the bygone heroine of romance and the fair lady of our dreams. There
was nothing subtle or hidden about her charms; her beauty was all there,
flaming and apparent: the spun-gold hair that comb nor confining pin could
restrain; the blue eyes that were like nothing but sapphires; two lips that
pouted, that were so red one could only think of cherries or some other
delicious crimson fruit in looking at them. She was growing a little stout, but
it did not seem to detract an iota from the grace of every step, pose, gesture.
One would not have wanted her white neck a mite less full or her beautiful arms
more slender. Never were hands more exquisite than hers, and it was a joy to
look at them when she threaded her needle or adjusted her gold thimble to her
taper middle finger as she sewed away on the little night-drawers or fashioned
a bodice or a bib.
Madame Ratignolle was very fond of Mrs. Pontellier, and often she took her
sewing and went over to sit with her in the afternoons. She was sitting there
the afternoon of the day the box arrived from New Orleans. She had possession
of the rocker, and she was busily engaged in sewing upon a diminutive pair of
night-drawers.
She had brought the pattern of the drawers for Mrs. Pontellier to cut
out—a marvel of construction, fashioned to enclose a baby’s body so
effectually that only two small eyes might look out from the garment, like an
Eskimo’s. They were designed for winter wear, when treacherous drafts
came down chimneys and insidious currents of deadly cold found their way
through key-holes.
Mrs. Pontellier’s mind was quite at rest concerning the present material
needs of her children, and she could not see the use of anticipating and making
winter night garments the subject of her summer meditations. But she did not
want to appear unamiable and uninterested, so she had brought forth newspapers,
which she spread upon the floor of the gallery, and under Madame
Ratignolle’s directions she had cut a pattern of the impervious garment.
Robert was there, seated as he had been the Sunday before, and Mrs. Pontellier
also occupied her former position on the upper step, leaning listlessly against
the post. Beside her was a box of bonbons, which she held out at intervals to
Madame Ratignolle.
That lady seemed at a loss to make a selection, but finally settled upon a
stick of nougat, wondering if it were not too rich; whether it could possibly
hurt her. Madame Ratignolle had been married seven years. About every two years
she had a baby. At that time she had three babies, and was beginning to think
of a fourth one. She was always talking about her “condition.” Her
“condition” was in no way apparent, and no one would have known a
thing about it but for her persistence in making it the subject of
conversation.
Robert started to reassure her, asserting that he had known a lady who had
subsisted upon nougat during the entire—but seeing the color mount into
Mrs. Pontellier’s face he checked himself and changed the subject.
Mrs. Pontellier, though she had married a Creole, was not thoroughly at home in
the society of Creoles; never before had she been thrown so intimately among
them. There were only Creoles that summer at Lebrun’s. They all knew each
other, and felt like one large family, among whom existed the most amicable
relations. A characteristic which distinguished them and which impressed Mrs.
Pontellier most forcibly was their entire absence of prudery. Their freedom of
expression was at first incomprehensible to her, though she had no difficulty
in reconciling it with a lofty chastity which in the Creole woman seems to be
inborn and unmistakable.
Never would Edna Pontellier forget the shock with which she heard Madame
Ratignolle relating to old Monsieur Farival the harrowing story of one of her
accouchements, withholding no intimate detail. She was growing
accustomed to like shocks, but she could not keep the mounting color back from
her cheeks. Oftener than once her coming had interrupted the droll story with
which Robert was entertaining some amused group of married women.
A book had gone the rounds of the pension. When it came her turn to read
it, she did so with profound astonishment. She felt moved to read the book in
secret and solitude, though none of the others had done so,—to hide it
from view at the sound of approaching footsteps. It was openly criticised and
freely discussed at table. Mrs. Pontellier gave over being astonished, and
concluded that wonders would never cease.

They formed a congenial group sitting there that summer afternoon—Madame
Ratignolle sewing away, often stopping to relate a story or incident with much
expressive gesture of her perfect hands; Robert and Mrs. Pontellier sitting
idle, exchanging occasional words, glances or smiles which indicated a certain
advanced stage of intimacy and camaraderie.
He had lived in her shadow during the past month. No one thought anything of
it. Many had predicted that Robert would devote himself to Mrs. Pontellier when
he arrived. Since the age of fifteen, which was eleven years before, Robert
each summer at Grand Isle had constituted himself the devoted attendant of some
fair dame or damsel. Sometimes it was a young girl, again a widow; but as often
as not it was some interesting married woman.
For two consecutive seasons he lived in the sunlight of Mademoiselle
Duvigne’s presence. But she died between summers; then Robert posed as an
inconsolable, prostrating himself at the feet of Madame Ratignolle for whatever
crumbs of sympathy and comfort she might be pleased to vouchsafe.
Mrs. Pontellier liked to sit and gaze at her fair companion as she might look
upon a faultless Madonna.
“Could any one fathom the cruelty beneath that fair exterior?”
murmured Robert. “She knew that I adored her once, and she let me adore
her. It was ‘Robert, come; go; stand up; sit down; do this; do that; see
if the baby sleeps; my thimble, please, that I left God knows where. Come and
read Daudet to me while I sew.’”
“Par exemple! I never had to ask. You were always there under my
feet, like a troublesome cat.”
“You mean like an adoring dog. And just as soon as Ratignolle appeared on
the scene, then it was like a dog. ‘Passez! Adieu! Allez
vous-en!’”
“Perhaps I feared to make Alphonse jealous,” she interjoined, with
excessive naïveté. That made them all laugh. The right hand jealous of the
left! The heart jealous of the soul! But for that matter, the Creole husband is
never jealous; with him the gangrene passion is one which has become dwarfed by
disuse.
Meanwhile Robert, addressing Mrs Pontellier, continued to tell of his one time
hopeless passion for Madame Ratignolle; of sleepless nights, of consuming
flames till the very sea sizzled when he took his daily plunge. While the lady
at the needle kept up a little running, contemptuous comment:
“Blagueur—farceur—gros bête, va!”
He never assumed this seriocomic tone when alone with Mrs. Pontellier. She
never knew precisely what to make of it; at that moment it was impossible for
her to guess how much of it was jest and what proportion was earnest. It was
understood that he had often spoken words of love to Madame Ratignolle, without
any thought of being taken seriously. Mrs. Pontellier was glad he had not
assumed a similar role toward herself. It would have been unacceptable and
annoying.
Mrs. Pontellier had brought her sketching materials, which she sometimes
dabbled with in an unprofessional way. She liked the dabbling. She felt in it
satisfaction of a kind which no other employment afforded her.
She had long wished to try herself on Madame Ratignolle. Never had that lady
seemed a more tempting subject than at that moment, seated there like some
sensuous Madonna, with the gleam of the fading day enriching her splendid
color.
Robert crossed over and seated himself upon the step below Mrs. Pontellier,
that he might watch her work. She handled her brushes with a certain ease and
freedom which came, not from long and close acquaintance with them, but from a
natural aptitude. Robert followed her work with close attention, giving forth
little ejaculatory expressions of appreciation in French, which he addressed to
Madame Ratignolle.
“Mais ce n’est pas mal! Elle s’y connait, elle a de la
force, oui.”
During his oblivious attention he once quietly rested his head against Mrs.
Pontellier’s arm. As gently she repulsed him. Once again he repeated the
offense. She could not but believe it to be thoughtlessness on his part; yet
that was no reason she should submit to it. She did not remonstrate, except
again to repulse him quietly but firmly. He offered no apology. The picture
completed bore no resemblance to Madame Ratignolle. She was greatly
disappointed to find that it did not look like her. But it was a fair enough
piece of work, and in many respects satisfying.
Mrs. Pontellier evidently did not think so. After surveying the sketch
critically she drew a broad smudge of paint across its surface, and crumpled
the paper between her hands.
The youngsters came tumbling up the steps, the quadroon following at the
respectful distance which they required her to observe. Mrs. Pontellier made
them carry her paints and things into the house. She sought to detain them for
a little talk and some pleasantry. But they were greatly in earnest. They had
only come to investigate the contents of the bonbon box. They accepted without
murmuring what she chose to give them, each holding out two chubby hands
scoop-like, in the vain hope that they might be filled; and then away they
went.
The sun was low in the west, and the breeze soft and languorous that came up
from the south, charged with the seductive odor of the sea. Children freshly
befurbelowed, were gathering for their games under the oaks. Their voices were
high and penetrating.
Madame Ratignolle folded her sewing, placing thimble, scissors, and thread all
neatly together in the roll, which she pinned securely. She complained of
faintness. Mrs. Pontellier flew for the cologne water and a fan. She bathed
Madame Ratignolle’s face with cologne, while Robert plied the fan with
unnecessary vigor.
The spell was soon over, and Mrs. Pontellier could not help wondering if there
were not a little imagination responsible for its origin, for the rose tint had
never faded from her friend’s face.
She stood watching the fair woman walk down the long line of galleries with the
grace and majesty which queens are sometimes supposed to possess. Her little
ones ran to meet her. Two of them clung about her white skirts, the third she
took from its nurse and with a thousand endearments bore it along in her own
fond, encircling arms. Though, as everybody well knew, the doctor had forbidden
her to lift so much as a pin!
“Are you going bathing?” asked Robert of Mrs. Pontellier. It was
not so much a question as a reminder.
“Oh, no,” she answered, with a tone of indecision. “I’m
tired; I think not.” Her glance wandered from his face away toward the
Gulf, whose sonorous murmur reached her like a loving but imperative entreaty.
“Oh, come!” he insisted. “You mustn’t miss your bath.
Come on. The water must be delicious; it will not hurt you. Come.”
He reached up for her big, rough straw hat that hung on a peg outside the door,
and put it on her head. They descended the steps, and walked away together
toward the beach. The sun was low in the west and the breeze was soft and warm.

Edna Pontellier could not have told why, wishing to go to the beach with
Robert, she should in the first place have declined, and in the second place
have followed in obedience to one of the two contradictory impulses which
impelled her.
A certain light was beginning to dawn dimly within her,—the light which,
showing the way, forbids it.
At that early period it served but to bewilder her. It moved her to dreams, to
thoughtfulness, to the shadowy anguish which had overcome her the midnight when
she had abandoned herself to tears.
In short, Mrs. Pontellier was beginning to realize her position in the universe
as a human being, and to recognize her relations as an individual to the world
within and about her. This may seem like a ponderous weight of wisdom to
descend upon the soul of a young woman of twenty-eight—perhaps more
wisdom than the Holy Ghost is usually pleased to vouchsafe to any woman.
But the beginning of things, of a world especially, is necessarily vague,
tangled, chaotic, and exceedingly disturbing. How few of us ever emerge from
such beginning! How many souls perish in its tumult!
The voice of the sea is seductive; never ceasing, whispering, clamoring,
murmuring, inviting the soul to wander for a spell in abysses of solitude; to
lose itself in mazes of inward contemplation.
The voice of the sea speaks to the soul. The touch of the sea is sensuous,
enfolding the body in its soft, close embrace.

Mrs. Pontellier was not a woman given to confidences, a characteristic hitherto
contrary to her nature. Even as a child she had lived her own small life all
within herself. At a very early period she had apprehended instinctively the
dual life—that outward existence which conforms, the inward life which
questions.
That summer at Grand Isle she began to loosen a little the mantle of reserve
that had always enveloped her. There may have been—there must have
been—influences, both subtle and apparent, working in their several ways
to induce her to do this; but the most obvious was the influence of Adèle
Ratignolle. The excessive physical charm of the Creole had first attracted her,
for Edna had a sensuous susceptibility to beauty. Then the candor of the
woman’s whole existence, which every one might read, and which formed so
striking a contrast to her own habitual reserve—this might have furnished
a link. Who can tell what metals the gods use in forging the subtle bond which
we call sympathy, which we might as well call love.
The two women went away one morning to the beach together, arm in arm, under
the huge white sunshade. Edna had prevailed upon Madame Ratignolle to leave the
children behind, though she could not induce her to relinquish a diminutive
roll of needlework, which Adèle begged to be allowed to slip into the depths of
her pocket. In some unaccountable way they had escaped from Robert.
The walk to the beach was no inconsiderable one, consisting as it did of a
long, sandy path, upon which a sporadic and tangled growth that bordered it on
either side made frequent and unexpected inroads. There were acres of yellow
camomile reaching out on either hand. Further away still, vegetable gardens
abounded, with frequent small plantations of orange or lemon trees intervening.
The dark green clusters glistened from afar in the sun.
The women were both of goodly height, Madame Ratignolle possessing the more
feminine and matronly figure. The charm of Edna Pontellier’s physique
stole insensibly upon you. The lines of her body were long, clean and
symmetrical; it was a body which occasionally fell into splendid poses; there
was no suggestion of the trim, stereotyped fashion-plate about it. A casual and
indiscriminating observer, in passing, might not cast a second glance upon the
figure. But with more feeling and discernment he would have recognized the
noble beauty of its modeling, and the graceful severity of poise and movement,
which made Edna Pontellier different from the crowd.
She wore a cool muslin that morning—white, with a waving vertical line of
brown running through it; also a white linen collar and the big straw hat which
she had taken from the peg outside the door. The hat rested any way on her
yellow-brown hair, that waved a little, was heavy, and clung close to her head.
Madame Ratignolle, more careful of her complexion, had twined a gauze veil
about her head. She wore dogskin gloves, with gauntlets that protected her
wrists. She was dressed in pure white, with a fluffiness of ruffles that became
her. The draperies and fluttering things which she wore suited her rich,
luxuriant beauty as a greater severity of line could not have done.
There were a number of bath-houses along the beach, of rough but solid
construction, built with small, protecting galleries facing the water. Each
house consisted of two compartments, and each family at Lebrun’s
possessed a compartment for itself, fitted out with all the essential
paraphernalia of the bath and whatever other conveniences the owners might
desire. The two women had no intention of bathing; they had just strolled down
to the beach for a walk and to be alone and near the water. The Pontellier and
Ratignolle compartments adjoined one another under the same roof.
Mrs. Pontellier had brought down her key through force of habit. Unlocking the
door of her bath-room she went inside, and soon emerged, bringing a rug, which
she spread upon the floor of the gallery, and two huge hair pillows covered
with crash, which she placed against the front of the building.
The two seated themselves there in the shade of the porch, side by side, with
their backs against the pillows and their feet extended. Madame Ratignolle
removed her veil, wiped her face with a rather delicate handkerchief, and
fanned herself with the fan which she always carried suspended somewhere about
her person by a long, narrow ribbon. Edna removed her collar and opened her
dress at the throat. She took the fan from Madame Ratignolle and began to fan
both herself and her companion. It was very warm, and for a while they did
nothing but exchange remarks about the heat, the sun, the glare. But there was
a breeze blowing, a choppy, stiff wind that whipped the water into froth. It
fluttered the skirts of the two women and kept them for a while engaged in
adjusting, readjusting, tucking in, securing hair-pins and hat-pins. A few
persons were sporting some distance away in the water. The beach was very still
of human sound at that hour. The lady in black was reading her morning
devotions on the porch of a neighboring bath-house. Two young lovers were
exchanging their hearts’ yearnings beneath the children’s tent,
which they had found unoccupied.
Edna Pontellier, casting her eyes about, had finally kept them at rest upon the
sea. The day was clear and carried the gaze out as far as the blue sky went;
there were a few white clouds suspended idly over the horizon. A lateen sail
was visible in the direction of Cat Island, and others to the south seemed
almost motionless in the far distance.
“Of whom—of what are you thinking?” asked Adèle of her
companion, whose countenance she had been watching with a little amused
attention, arrested by the absorbed expression which seemed to have seized and
fixed every feature into a statuesque repose.
“Nothing,” returned Mrs. Pontellier, with a start, adding at once:
“How stupid! But it seems to me it is the reply we make instinctively to
such a question. Let me see,” she went on, throwing back her head and
narrowing her fine eyes till they shone like two vivid points of light.
“Let me see. I was really not conscious of thinking of anything; but
perhaps I can retrace my thoughts.”
“Oh! never mind!” laughed Madame Ratignolle. “I am not quite
so exacting. I will let you off this time. It is really too hot to think,
especially to think about thinking.”
“But for the fun of it,” persisted Edna. “First of all, the
sight of the water stretching so far away, those motionless sails against the
blue sky, made a delicious picture that I just wanted to sit and look at. The
hot wind beating in my face made me think—without any connection that I
can trace of a summer day in Kentucky, of a meadow that seemed as big as the
ocean to the very little girl walking through the grass, which was higher than
her waist. She threw out her arms as if swimming when she walked, beating the
tall grass as one strikes out in the water. Oh, I see the connection
now!”
“Where were you going that day in Kentucky, walking through the
grass?”
“I don’t remember now. I was just walking diagonally across a big
field. My sun-bonnet obstructed the view. I could see only the stretch of green
before me, and I felt as if I must walk on forever, without coming to the end
of it. I don’t remember whether I was frightened or pleased. I must have
been entertained.
“Likely as not it was Sunday,” she laughed; “and I was
running away from prayers, from the Presbyterian service, read in a spirit of
gloom by my father that chills me yet to think of.”
“And have you been running away from prayers ever since, ma
chère?” asked Madame Ratignolle, amused.
“No! oh, no!” Edna hastened to say. “I was a little
unthinking child in those days, just following a misleading impulse without
question. On the contrary, during one period of my life religion took a firm
hold upon me; after I was twelve and until—until—why, I suppose
until now, though I never thought much about it—just driven along by
habit. But do you know,” she broke off, turning her quick eyes upon
Madame Ratignolle and leaning forward a little so as to bring her face quite
close to that of her companion, “sometimes I feel this summer as if I
were walking through the green meadow again; idly, aimlessly, unthinking and
unguided.”
Madame Ratignolle laid her hand over that of Mrs. Pontellier, which was near
her. Seeing that the hand was not withdrawn, she clasped it firmly and warmly.
She even stroked it a little, fondly, with the other hand, murmuring in an
undertone, “Pauvre chérie.”
The action was at first a little confusing to Edna, but she soon lent herself
readily to the Creole’s gentle caress. She was not accustomed to an
outward and spoken expression of affection, either in herself or in others. She
and her younger sister, Janet, had quarreled a good deal through force of
unfortunate habit. Her older sister, Margaret, was matronly and dignified,
probably from having assumed matronly and housewifely responsibilities too
early in life, their mother having died when they were quite young. Margaret
was not effusive; she was practical. Edna had had an occasional girl friend,
but whether accidentally or not, they seemed to have been all of one
type—the self-contained. She never realized that the reserve of her own
character had much, perhaps everything, to do with this. Her most intimate
friend at school had been one of rather exceptional intellectual gifts, who
wrote fine-sounding essays, which Edna admired and strove to imitate; and with
her she talked and glowed over the English classics, and sometimes held
religious and political controversies.
Edna often wondered at one propensity which sometimes had inwardly disturbed
her without causing any outward show or manifestation on her part. At a very
early age—perhaps it was when she traversed the ocean of waving
grass—she remembered that she had been passionately enamored of a
dignified and sad-eyed cavalry officer who visited her father in Kentucky. She
could not leave his presence when he was there, nor remove her eyes from his
face, which was something like Napoleon’s, with a lock of black hair
failing across the forehead. But the cavalry officer melted imperceptibly out
of her existence.
At another time her affections were deeply engaged by a young gentleman who
visited a lady on a neighboring plantation. It was after they went to
Mississippi to live. The young man was engaged to be married to the young lady,
and they sometimes called upon Margaret, driving over of afternoons in a buggy.
Edna was a little miss, just merging into her teens; and the realization that
she herself was nothing, nothing, nothing to the engaged young man was a bitter
affliction to her. But he, too, went the way of dreams.
She was a grown young woman when she was overtaken by what she supposed to be
the climax of her fate. It was when the face and figure of a great tragedian
began to haunt her imagination and stir her senses. The persistence of the
infatuation lent it an aspect of genuineness. The hopelessness of it colored it
with the lofty tones of a great passion.
The picture of the tragedian stood enframed upon her desk. Any one may possess
the portrait of a tragedian without exciting suspicion or comment. (This was a
sinister reflection which she cherished.) In the presence of others she
expressed admiration for his exalted gifts, as she handed the photograph around
and dwelt upon the fidelity of the likeness. When alone she sometimes picked it
up and kissed the cold glass passionately.
Her marriage to Léonce Pontellier was purely an accident, in this respect
resembling many other marriages which masquerade as the decrees of Fate. It was
in the midst of her secret great passion that she met him. He fell in love, as
men are in the habit of doing, and pressed his suit with an earnestness and an
ardor which left nothing to be desired. He pleased her; his absolute devotion
flattered her. She fancied there was a sympathy of thought and taste between
them, in which fancy she was mistaken. Add to this the violent opposition of
her father and her sister Margaret to her marriage with a Catholic, and we need
seek no further for the motives which led her to accept Monsieur Pontellier for
her husband.
The acme of bliss, which would have been a marriage with the tragedian, was not
for her in this world. As the devoted wife of a man who worshiped her, she felt
she would take her place with a certain dignity in the world of reality,
closing the portals forever behind her upon the realm of romance and dreams.
But it was not long before the tragedian had gone to join the cavalry officer
and the engaged young man and a few others; and Edna found herself face to face
with the realities. She grew fond of her husband, realizing with some
unaccountable satisfaction that no trace of passion or excessive and fictitious
warmth colored her affection, thereby threatening its dissolution.
She was fond of her children in an uneven, impulsive way. She would sometimes
gather them passionately to her heart; she would sometimes forget them. The
year before they had spent part of the summer with their grandmother Pontellier
in Iberville. Feeling secure regarding their happiness and welfare, she did not
miss them except with an occasional intense longing. Their absence was a sort
of relief, though she did not admit this, even to herself. It seemed to free
her of a responsibility which she had blindly assumed and for which Fate had
not fitted her.
Edna did not reveal so much as all this to Madame Ratignolle that summer day
when they sat with faces turned to the sea. But a good part of it escaped her.
She had put her head down on Madame Ratignolle’s shoulder. She was
flushed and felt intoxicated with the sound of her own voice and the
unaccustomed taste of candor. It muddled her like wine, or like a first breath
of freedom.
There was the sound of approaching voices. It was Robert, surrounded by a troop
of children, searching for them. The two little Pontelliers were with him, and
he carried Madame Ratignolle’s little girl in his arms. There were other
children beside, and two nurse-maids followed, looking disagreeable and
resigned.
The women at once rose and began to shake out their draperies and relax their
muscles. Mrs. Pontellier threw the cushions and rug into the bath-house. The
children all scampered off to the awning, and they stood there in a line,
gazing upon the intruding lovers, still exchanging their vows and sighs. The
lovers got up, with only a silent protest, and walked slowly away somewhere
else.
The children possessed themselves of the tent, and Mrs. Pontellier went over to
join them.
Madame Ratignolle begged Robert to accompany her to the house; she complained
of cramp in her limbs and stiffness of the joints. She leaned draggingly upon
his arm as they walked.

“Do me a favor, Robert,” spoke the pretty woman at his side, almost
as soon as she and Robert had started their slow, homeward way. She looked up
in his face, leaning on his arm beneath the encircling shadow of the umbrella
which he had lifted.
“Granted; as many as you like,” he returned, glancing down into her
eyes that were full of thoughtfulness and some speculation.
“I only ask for one; let Mrs. Pontellier alone.”
“Tiens!” he exclaimed, with a sudden, boyish laugh.
“Voilà que Madame Ratignolle est jalouse!”
“Nonsense! I’m in earnest; I mean what I say. Let Mrs. Pontellier
alone.”
“Why?” he asked; himself growing serious at his companion’s
solicitation.
“She is not one of us; she is not like us. She might make the unfortunate
blunder of taking you seriously.”
His face flushed with annoyance, and taking off his soft hat he began to beat
it impatiently against his leg as he walked. “Why shouldn’t she
take me seriously?” he demanded sharply. “Am I a comedian, a clown,
a jack-in-the-box? Why shouldn’t she? You Creoles! I have no patience
with you! Am I always to be regarded as a feature of an amusing programme? I
hope Mrs. Pontellier does take me seriously. I hope she has discernment enough
to find in me something besides the blagueur. If I thought there was any
doubt—”
“Oh, enough, Robert!” she broke into his heated outburst.
“You are not thinking of what you are saying. You speak with about as
little reflection as we might expect from one of those children down there
playing in the sand. If your attentions to any married women here were ever
offered with any intention of being convincing, you would not be the gentleman
we all know you to be, and you would be unfit to associate with the wives and
daughters of the people who trust you.”
Madame Ratignolle had spoken what she believed to be the law and the gospel.
The young man shrugged his shoulders impatiently.
“Oh! well! That isn’t it,” slamming his hat down vehemently
upon his head. “You ought to feel that such things are not flattering to
say to a fellow.”
“Should our whole intercourse consist of an exchange of compliments?
Ma foi!”
“It isn’t pleasant to have a woman tell you—” he went
on, unheedingly, but breaking off suddenly: “Now if I were like
Arobin—you remember Alcée Arobin and that story of the consul’s
wife at Biloxi?” And he related the story of Alcée Arobin and the
consul’s wife; and another about the tenor of the French Opera, who
received letters which should never have been written; and still other stories,
grave and gay, till Mrs. Pontellier and her possible propensity for taking
young men seriously was apparently forgotten.
Madame Ratignolle, when they had regained her cottage, went in to take the
hour’s rest which she considered helpful. Before leaving her, Robert
begged her pardon for the impatience—he called it rudeness—with
which he had received her well-meant caution.
“You made one mistake, Adèle,” he said, with a light smile;
“there is no earthly possibility of Mrs. Pontellier ever taking me
seriously. You should have warned me against taking myself seriously. Your
advice might then have carried some weight and given me subject for some
reflection. Au revoir. But you look tired,” he added,
solicitously. “Would you like a cup of bouillon? Shall I stir you a
toddy? Let me mix you a toddy with a drop of Angostura.”
She acceded to the suggestion of bouillon, which was grateful and acceptable.
He went himself to the kitchen, which was a building apart from the cottages
and lying to the rear of the house. And he himself brought her the golden-brown
bouillon, in a dainty Sèvres cup, with a flaky cracker or two on the saucer.
She thrust a bare, white arm from the curtain which shielded her open door, and
received the cup from his hands. She told him he was a bon garçon, and
she meant it. Robert thanked her and turned away toward “the
house.”
The lovers were just entering the grounds of the pension. They were
leaning toward each other as the water-oaks bent from the sea. There was not a
particle of earth beneath their feet. Their heads might have been turned
upside-down, so absolutely did they tread upon blue ether. The lady in black,
creeping behind them, looked a trifle paler and more jaded than usual. There
was no sign of Mrs. Pontellier and the children. Robert scanned the distance
for any such apparition. They would doubtless remain away till the dinner hour.
The young man ascended to his mother’s room. It was situated at the top
of the house, made up of odd angles and a queer, sloping ceiling. Two broad
dormer windows looked out toward the Gulf, and as far across it as a
man’s eye might reach. The furnishings of the room were light, cool, and
practical.
Madame Lebrun was busily engaged at the sewing-machine. A little black girl sat
on the floor, and with her hands worked the treadle of the machine. The Creole
woman does not take any chances which may be avoided of imperiling her health.
Robert went over and seated himself on the broad sill of one of the dormer
windows. He took a book from his pocket and began energetically to read it,
judging by the precision and frequency with which he turned the leaves. The
sewing-machine made a resounding clatter in the room; it was of a ponderous,
by-gone make. In the lulls, Robert and his mother exchanged bits of desultory
conversation.
“Where is Mrs. Pontellier?”
“Down at the beach with the children.”
“I promised to lend her the Goncourt. Don’t forget to take it down
when you go; it’s there on the bookshelf over the small table.”
Clatter, clatter, clatter, bang! for the next five or eight minutes.
“Where is Victor going with the rockaway?”
“The rockaway? Victor?”
“Yes; down there in front. He seems to be getting ready to drive away
somewhere.”
“Call him.” Clatter, clatter!
Robert uttered a shrill, piercing whistle which might have been heard back at
the wharf.
“He won’t look up.”
Madame Lebrun flew to the window. She called “Victor!” She waved a
handkerchief and called again. The young fellow below got into the vehicle and
started the horse off at a gallop.
Madame Lebrun went back to the machine, crimson with annoyance. Victor was the
younger son and brother—a tête montée, with a temper which invited
violence and a will which no ax could break.
“Whenever you say the word I’m ready to thrash any amount of reason
into him that he’s able to hold.”
“If your father had only lived!” Clatter, clatter, clatter,
clatter, bang! It was a fixed belief with Madame Lebrun that the conduct of the
universe and all things pertaining thereto would have been manifestly of a more
intelligent and higher order had not Monsieur Lebrun been removed to other
spheres during the early years of their married life.
“What do you hear from Montel?” Montel was a middle-aged gentleman
whose vain ambition and desire for the past twenty years had been to fill the
void which Monsieur Lebrun’s taking off had left in the Lebrun household.
Clatter, clatter, bang, clatter!
“I have a letter somewhere,” looking in the machine drawer and
finding the letter in the bottom of the workbasket. “He says to tell you
he will be in Vera Cruz the beginning of next month,”—clatter,
clatter!—“and if you still have the intention of joining
him”—bang! clatter, clatter, bang!
“Why didn’t you tell me so before, mother? You know I
wanted—” Clatter, clatter, clatter!
“Do you see Mrs. Pontellier starting back with the children? She will be
in late to luncheon again. She never starts to get ready for luncheon till the
last minute.” Clatter, clatter! “Where are you going?”
“Where did you say the Goncourt was?”

Every light in the hall was ablaze; every lamp turned as high as it could be
without smoking the chimney or threatening explosion. The lamps were fixed at
intervals against the wall, encircling the whole room. Some one had gathered
orange and lemon branches, and with these fashioned graceful festoons between.
The dark green of the branches stood out and glistened against the white muslin
curtains which draped the windows, and which puffed, floated, and flapped at
the capricious will of a stiff breeze that swept up from the Gulf.
It was Saturday night a few weeks after the intimate conversation held between
Robert and Madame Ratignolle on their way from the beach. An unusual number of
husbands, fathers, and friends had come down to stay over Sunday; and they were
being suitably entertained by their families, with the material help of Madame
Lebrun. The dining tables had all been removed to one end of the hall, and the
chairs ranged about in rows and in clusters. Each little family group had had
its say and exchanged its domestic gossip earlier in the evening. There was now
an apparent disposition to relax; to widen the circle of confidences and give a
more general tone to the conversation.
Many of the children had been permitted to sit up beyond their usual bedtime. A
small band of them were lying on their stomachs on the floor looking at the
colored sheets of the comic papers which Mr. Pontellier had brought down. The
little Pontellier boys were permitting them to do so, and making their
authority felt.
Music, dancing, and a recitation or two were the entertainments furnished, or
rather, offered. But there was nothing systematic about the programme, no
appearance of prearrangement nor even premeditation.
At an early hour in the evening the Farival twins were prevailed upon to play
the piano. They were girls of fourteen, always clad in the Virgin’s
colors, blue and white, having been dedicated to the Blessed Virgin at their
baptism. They played a duet from “Zampa,” and at the earnest
solicitation of every one present followed it with the overture to “The
Poet and the Peasant.”
“Allez vous-en! Sapristi!” shrieked the parrot outside the
door. He was the only being present who possessed sufficient candor to admit
that he was not listening to these gracious performances for the first time
that summer. Old Monsieur Farival, grandfather of the twins, grew indignant
over the interruption, and insisted upon having the bird removed and consigned
to regions of darkness. Victor Lebrun objected; and his decrees were as
immutable as those of Fate. The parrot fortunately offered no further
interruption to the entertainment, the whole venom of his nature apparently
having been cherished up and hurled against the twins in that one impetuous
outburst.
Later a young brother and sister gave recitations, which every one present had
heard many times at winter evening entertainments in the city.
A little girl performed a skirt dance in the center of the floor. The mother
played her accompaniments and at the same time watched her daughter with greedy
admiration and nervous apprehension. She need have had no apprehension. The
child was mistress of the situation. She had been properly dressed for the
occasion in black tulle and black silk tights. Her little neck and arms were
bare, and her hair, artificially crimped, stood out like fluffy black plumes
over her head. Her poses were full of grace, and her little black-shod toes
twinkled as they shot out and upward with a rapidity and suddenness which were
bewildering.
But there was no reason why every one should not dance. Madame Ratignolle could
not, so it was she who gaily consented to play for the others. She played very
well, keeping excellent waltz time and infusing an expression into the strains
which was indeed inspiring. She was keeping up her music on account of the
children, she said; because she and her husband both considered it a means of
brightening the home and making it attractive.
Almost every one danced but the twins, who could not be induced to separate
during the brief period when one or the other should be whirling around the
room in the arms of a man. They might have danced together, but they did not
think of it.
The children were sent to bed. Some went submissively; others with shrieks and
protests as they were dragged away. They had been permitted to sit up till
after the ice-cream, which naturally marked the limit of human indulgence.
The ice-cream was passed around with cake—gold and silver cake arranged
on platters in alternate slices; it had been made and frozen during the
afternoon back of the kitchen by two black women, under the supervision of
Victor. It was pronounced a great success—excellent if it had only
contained a little less vanilla or a little more sugar, if it had been frozen a
degree harder, and if the salt might have been kept out of portions of it.
Victor was proud of his achievement, and went about recommending it and urging
every one to partake of it to excess.
After Mrs. Pontellier had danced twice with her husband, once with Robert, and
once with Monsieur Ratignolle, who was thin and tall and swayed like a reed in
the wind when he danced, she went out on the gallery and seated herself on the
low window-sill, where she commanded a view of all that went on in the hall and
could look out toward the Gulf. There was a soft effulgence in the east. The
moon was coming up, and its mystic shimmer was casting a million lights across
the distant, restless water.
“Would you like to hear Mademoiselle Reisz play?” asked Robert,
coming out on the porch where she was. Of course Edna would like to hear
Mademoiselle Reisz play; but she feared it would be useless to entreat her.
“I’ll ask her,” he said. “I’ll tell her that you
want to hear her. She likes you. She will come.” He turned and hurried
away to one of the far cottages, where Mademoiselle Reisz was shuffling away.
She was dragging a chair in and out of her room, and at intervals objecting to
the crying of a baby, which a nurse in the adjoining cottage was endeavoring to
put to sleep. She was a disagreeable little woman, no longer young, who had
quarreled with almost every one, owing to a temper which was self-assertive and
a disposition to trample upon the rights of others. Robert prevailed upon her
without any too great difficulty.
She entered the hall with him during a lull in the dance. She made an awkward,
imperious little bow as she went in. She was a homely woman, with a small
weazened face and body and eyes that glowed. She had absolutely no taste in
dress, and wore a batch of rusty black lace with a bunch of artificial violets
pinned to the side of her hair.
“Ask Mrs. Pontellier what she would like to hear me play,” she
requested of Robert. She sat perfectly still before the piano, not touching the
keys, while Robert carried her message to Edna at the window. A general air of
surprise and genuine satisfaction fell upon every one as they saw the pianist
enter. There was a settling down, and a prevailing air of expectancy
everywhere. Edna was a trifle embarrassed at being thus signaled out for the
imperious little woman’s favor. She would not dare to choose, and begged
that Mademoiselle Reisz would please herself in her selections.
Edna was what she herself called very fond of music. Musical strains, well
rendered, had a way of evoking pictures in her mind. She sometimes liked to sit
in the room of mornings when Madame Ratignolle played or practiced. One piece
which that lady played Edna had entitled “Solitude.” It was a
short, plaintive, minor strain. The name of the piece was something else, but
she called it “Solitude.” When she heard it there came before her
imagination the figure of a man standing beside a desolate rock on the
seashore. He was naked. His attitude was one of hopeless resignation as he
looked toward a distant bird winging its flight away from him.
Another piece called to her mind a dainty young woman clad in an Empire gown,
taking mincing dancing steps as she came down a long avenue between tall
hedges. Again, another reminded her of children at play, and still another of
nothing on earth but a demure lady stroking a cat.
The very first chords which Mademoiselle Reisz struck upon the piano sent a
keen tremor down Mrs. Pontellier’s spinal column. It was not the first
time she had heard an artist at the piano. Perhaps it was the first time she
was ready, perhaps the first time her being was tempered to take an impress of
the abiding truth.
She waited for the material pictures which she thought would gather and blaze
before her imagination. She waited in vain. She saw no pictures of solitude, of
hope, of longing, or of despair. But the very passions themselves were aroused
within her soul, swaying it, lashing it, as the waves daily beat upon her
splendid body. She trembled, she was choking, and the tears blinded her.
Mademoiselle had finished. She arose, and bowing her stiff, lofty bow, she went
away, stopping for neither thanks nor applause. As she passed along the gallery
she patted Edna upon the shoulder.
“Well, how did you like my music?” she asked. The young woman was
unable to answer; she pressed the hand of the pianist convulsively.
Mademoiselle Reisz perceived her agitation and even her tears. She patted her
again upon the shoulder as she said:
“You are the only one worth playing for. Those others? Bah!” and
she went shuffling and sidling on down the gallery toward her room.
But she was mistaken about “those others.” Her playing had aroused
a fever of enthusiasm. “What passion!” “What an
artist!” “I have always said no one could play Chopin like
Mademoiselle Reisz!” “That last prelude! Bon Dieu! It shakes a
man!”
It was growing late, and there was a general disposition to disband. But some
one, perhaps it was Robert, thought of a bath at that mystic hour and under
that mystic moon.
