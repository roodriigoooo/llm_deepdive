    "### *Neural Machine Translation of Rare Words with Subword Units, Sennrich et. al (2015)*\n",
    "\n",
    "Byte-pair encoding (BPE) is a compression algorithm that was first described by Philip Gage in 1994. This original version of BPE encoded strings of text into smaller strings of text by merging and replacing the highest-frequency contiguous pair of bytes. Byte-pair encoding was then [adapted by Rico Sennrich, Barry Haddow and Alexandra Birch](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.07909) to optimize neural machine translation, and namely to solve the problem of translation of rare words. word-level models, relying on complete words, can't possibly generate or translate words they had never seen before, a problem that becomes bigger when dealing with various dialects, alphabets, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sennrich et.al showed that translation of rare words is possible through their encoding via subword units, and additionally created a vocabulary, (a set of tokens, each one of variable-length) that was fixed in size but that could handle any input given to it. the argument was that, the translation of some word is possible and 'transparent' for any competent translator, even if the word is novel or unknown, based on an analysis of known subwords contained within that word (morphemes or phonemes).\n",
    "\n",
    "> a very simplified view of the algorithm:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> - Start with a vocabulary that is just the raw symbols (characters)\n",
    "> - Repeatedly merge the most-common adjacent symbol pairs into new, longer tokens.\n",
    "> - Stop when you hit a fixed vocab size (e.g. 50k)\n",
    "\n",
    "### *Language Models are Unsupervised Multitask Learners, Radford et.al (2019)*\n",
    "\n",
    "in the context of language models, this paper introduced BPE as a mechanism for language models, recognizing and leveraging the many desirable properties that the algorithm had in the context of language modeling. alternatives to BPE included classic word-level tokenisers that, as Sennrich et.al suggested, choken on funky slang, creative spelling, emojis, and anything else they had never seen.\n",
    "\n",
    "> nice compression (one token per known word) but brittle. any typoe or neologism explodes into an `<unk>` or a pile of fallback characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "character-level models fixed this coverage, but exploded sequence length and more easily lost track of higher-level patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "> antidisestablishmentarianism -> 28 tokens. long sequences, slower training, limits how much context we can put into the model's window.\n",
    "\n",
    "BPE is described to be a middle ground between both: shorter than characters, nimbler than words. It produces fewer tokens than a pure character model (shorter sequences) while staying more adaptable than a pure word model.\n",

    "computers ultimately read and write bytes, and not abstract code points like the ones shown above. An *encoding* is a mapping turning each code point sequence to a byte sequence (a process called serialization) and back (deserialization). The Unicode Standard defines three main character encoding standards used for electronic communication:\n",
    "\n",
    "- UTF-8 -> 1 byte unit size, variable length (1-4 bytes per code point), typically used in the web, APIs and Unix.\n",
    "- UTF-16 -> 2 bytes unit size (variable length).\n",
    "- UTF-32 -> 4 bytes unit size (fixed-width)\n",
    "\n",
    "almost every single webpage is transmitted as UTF-8, mostly due to the following reasons:\n",
    "- it is the only encoding standard that is backward compatible with ASCII (another encoding standard used in a lot of legacy tooling) meaning that any text file encoded in ASCII can be decoded as UTF-8 to get exactly the same result.\n",
    "- it is space efficient, at least for latin corpora. English text, for instance, stays at around 1 byte per character, whereas UTF-16 or 32 double or quadruple it (see below).\n",
    "\n",
    "> a note on something i was personally confused with:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> - UTF-8 is 'variable-length' because different characters need 1-4 bytes to encode. but **each individual byte** can still store only 0-255 ($2^8 - 1$), being those 256 byte values what a byte-level tokenizer treats as its entire vocabulary. Do not confuse symbols with byte tokens. UTF-8 has 256 distinct byte tokens, which you can combine to do way more than 256 characters."

    "Running our BPE algorithm for 500 merges yields a final vocabulary size of 756 (the 256 original ones + 500 new ones). notice also the new sequence length, down from 3.8 million to around 1.7 million. but we need to be precise about what was compressed here and why we care.\n",
    "\n",
    "- the 1.7 million is token count, and not byte file size. before BPE mostly every byte was a separate model (ASCII-based corpora), and the model needed to process a sequence 3.8 million bytes long.\n",
    "- after 500 merges, we introduced 500 new symbols; the sequence now contains only 1.7 million tokens.\n",
    "- we eliminated ~55% of the token-level redundancy the model would otherwise see. but **we did not shrink the file on disk**. actually, storing each token id as a 32-bit integer (4 bytes), the 'compressed' representation is actually bigger (1.7 million x 4 > 3.8).\n",
